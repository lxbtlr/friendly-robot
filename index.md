# Hello, my name is Alex Butler

I'm an Electrical & Computer Engineering Student at Olin College of Engineering. 
I've primarily do work with embedded systems, power converters, and computer architecture.
I have a catalog of personal projects that I have worked on over the last four years, 
while working in industry and undergraduate research.
I'm always happy to learn about future work opportunities that share my interests! 
Say hey!
